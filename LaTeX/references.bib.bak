abstract="We present a tool for annotating Latex documents with comments. Our annotations are placed in the left, right, or both margins, and connected to the corresponding positions in the text with arrows (so-called leaders). Problems of this type have been studied under the name boundary labeling. We consider various leader types (straight-line, rectilinear, and B{\'e}zier) and modify existing algorithms to allow for annotations of varying height. We have implemented our algorithms in Lua; they are available for download as an easy-to-use Luatex package.",
