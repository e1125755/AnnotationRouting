abstract="We present a tool for annotating Latex documents with comments. Our annotations are placed in the left, right, or both margins, and connected to the corresponding positions in the text with arrows (so-called leaders). Problems of this type have been studied under the name boundary labeling. We consider various leader types (straight-line, rectilinear, and B{\'e}zier) and modify existing algorithms to allow for annotations of varying height. We have implemented our algorithms in Lua; they are available for download as an easy-to-use Luatex package.",

  abstract  = {Boundary labeling deals with annotating features in images such that labels are placed outside of the image and are connected by curves (so-called leaders) to the corresponding features. While boundary labeling has been extensively investigated from an algorithmic perspective, the research on its readability has been neglected. In this paper we present the first formal user study on the readability of boundary labeling. We consider the four most studied leader types with respect to their performance, i.e., whether and how fast a viewer can assign a feature to its label and vice versa. We give a detailed analysis of the results regarding the readability of the four models and discuss their aesthetic qualities based on the users' preference judgments and interviews.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel real-time algorithm to integrate internal and external labels of arbitrary size into 3D visualizations. Moreover, comprehensive dynamic content can be displayed in annotation boxes. Our system employs multiple metrics in order to achieve an effective and aesthetic label layout with adjustable weights. The layout algorithm employs several heuristics to reduce the search space of a complex layout task. Initial layouts are refined by label agents, i.e., local strategies to optimize the layout and to minimize the flow of layout elements in subsequent frames.},

We first place disjoint labels around an axis-parallel rectangle that contains the points. Then we connect each label to its point such that no two connections intersect. Such an approach is common e.g. in technical drawings and medical atlases, but so far the problem has not been studied in the literature. The new problem is interesting in that it is a mixture of a label-placement and a graph-drawing problem.},
